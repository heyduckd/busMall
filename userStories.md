Hey there, welcome to BusMall.

We have a project for you that we would like to have in hand by the end of the week.
Below is the criteria for the project and details that you will need to accomplish this task most successfully.

We are a young startup in the planning stages. The goal is to sell select products in a catalog that we place in every Puget Sound Transit Bus. Our consumers are commuting to and from work on a daily basis, so catching them during these times will only be effective if we offer them what they want.

In order to figure out which of our prototype products must go into production, we need to know which product our potential consumers want the most. That is where you come in.

Out of our 15 prototypes, we want to know which are the most popular based on a focus group study.

Your job is to create the app that will be used in each focus group to determine the popularity of the products.

AS A USER:
  -I want to see three random product images at a time.
  -I want to see the product info (Name, Purpose, Price, etc.).
  -I want to be able to vote by clicking one of the three products.
  -Once I vote, I want three new pictures to appear to vote again.
  -Once I have voted 15 times, I want to see my results by pressing a button.

AS A DEVELOPER:
  -I want to ensure that when three images populate the screen, they have no chance of being the same image.
  -I want to keep track of how many times each image has been clicked.
  -I want to store the product info for each product in an array.
  -I want to have each image appear to be the same size.
  -I want the images to automatically recycle and repopulate once the user votes.

AS THE RESEARCH TEAM:
  -We want to know which products are most popular in each focus group.
  -We don't want the users to see the voting results until after 15 selections have been made.
  -We only want the voting results to be seen if the user clicks a button.
  -We want to see visual representation of the data we collect.
