This is the README for BusMall.

The first thing I did was create a repo on Github and then cloned it to the directory that I created for week three.

Previously, I had already downloaded the image files for this project, so the img directory was already populated.

Once the repos were connected, I pushed all my local content to a new branch (jan18).

The next thing I did was write this first chunk of the README. Now I'm going to push this again.

Just wrote basic preliminary code in index.html.

END OF JAN 18:

Got images to populate the index.html page and eliminated possibility for duplicate images. Also noticed that my original image size was pretty big so I cut the dimensions in half to make them more manageable. Going to do some styling before I quit for the night.
