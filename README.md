This is the README for BusMall.

The first thing I did was create a repo on Github and then cloned it to the directory that I created for week three.

Previously, I had already downloaded the image files for this project, so the img directory was already populated.

Once the repos were connected, I pushed all my local content to a new branch (jan18).

The next thing I did was write this first chunk of the README. Now I'm going to push this again.
